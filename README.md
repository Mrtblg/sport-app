This is a simple React app with some navigation and CRUD operations

Based on Premier ligue football teams and there players

## Main subjects avoided

Traductions, the text is hardcoded
Real responsiveness (the app will adapt to your screen but the experience is not so good)
Design (minimal graphics but with scalable techno)
The CUD part is faked locally
